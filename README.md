# CEVA Gen-e2 POC

# Project Overview
CEVA Logistics is a global logistics provider seeking to accelerate their digital transformation and enhance their software development capabilities.

CEVA Logistics digital team aims to accelerate product evolution, enhance agile processes, and automate its software development lifecycle capabilities through the implementation of PALO IT's AI-Enhanced Software Engineering methodology (Gen-e2). The project focuses on modernizing integration flows, particularly migrating from IBM IIB (ESQL) to AWS Lambda (TypeScript), while implementing AI-driven coding practices and automation across the full development lifecycle.

## Challenges
- **Accelerate Product Evolution**: Need to speed up the delivery of product enhancements and reduce time-to-market
- **Enhance Agile Processes**: Improve current development workflows and team collaboration
- **Automate Software Development Lifecycle**: Implement automation for test generation, documentation, and DevOps practices
- **Modernize Integration Stack**: Migrate legacy IBM IIB (ESQL) systems to modern AWS Lambda (TypeScript) architecture
- **Strengthen DevOps and Security**: Implement robust CI/CD pipelines and security practices (SAST/DAST)
- **Improve Code Quality and Traceability**: Enhance developer productivity and maintain high code standards
- **Integration with Existing Tools**: Seamlessly integrate AI tools into CEVA's current technology stack (GitLab, AWS, Karate, etc.)

## Proposal
- **AI-Enhanced Development Lifecycle**: Implementation of AI-driven coding practices for automated user story creation, documentation, test generation, and code refactoring
- **Integration Stack Modernization**: Migration from IBM IIB (ESQL) to AWS Lambda (TypeScript) using AI-assisted translation
- **DevOps Pipeline Enhancement**: Strengthening of CI/CD and security practices (SAST/DAST) with automated workflows
- **Gen-e2 Methodology Implementation**: Full adoption of PALO IT's AI-Enhanced Software Engineering methodology
- **Tool Integration**: Seamless integration of AI tools into CEVA's existing technology stack
- **Team Enablement**: Comprehensive training and change adoption support for internal teams
- **Reusable Frameworks**: Development of transformation templates and best practices for broader organizational rollout

## Deliverables
### Outputs
- **Translated Integration Flow(s)**: AI-generated TypeScript code from ESQL with tests, documentation, functional validation, and deployment to development, testing, and production environments
- **Working Ticket Workflow Prototype**: Real product ticket processed using Gen-e2 tools from business input to sprint-ready items
- **Intermediate Representation Templates**: Mapping schemas/models enabling scalable ESQL to TypeScript migration
- **Comparison Dashboards & Metrics**: Before/after data on speed, quality, and automation impact from Gen-e2
- **AI-Augmented Agile Playbook**: Updated backlog and sprint planning approach integrating Gen-e2 tools and outputs
- **PoC Summary & Roadmap Recommendations**: Wrap-up report, next steps for scale-up, and governance for LLM use across CEVA
- **Monthly Status Reports**: Regular progress updates and milestone confirmations

### Outcomes
- **Accelerated Business-to-Tech Delivery**: Faster conversion of business needs into working software
- **Modernized Integration Stack**: Validated migration from IBM IIB to AWS Lambda architecture
- **AI-Enhanced Development Lifecycle**: Automated key development tasks and improved productivity
- **Reusable Frameworks & Patterns**: Templates and best practices for broader organizational rollout
- **Team Enablement & Change Adoption**: Upskilled CEVA teams in Gen-e2 methodology
- **Validated LLM Strategy**: Demonstrated secure, compliant use of existing Mistral/Google LLM resources

## What is not included
- **Full-scale production rollout** beyond the POC validation scope (limited to selected use cases for proof of concept)
- **Complete migration** of all CEVA's integration flows (POC focuses on Renault2MoveECAR inbound flow and selected use cases)
- **Hardware provisioning** or infrastructure setup beyond development environments
- **Third-party licensing costs** for additional tools or platforms not already owned by CEVA
- **Post-POC maintenance** or ongoing support beyond the 12-week engagement period
- **Integration with systems** not specified in the original scope (Renault2MoveECAR inbound flow focus)

## Assumptions
### Stakeholder Availability
- Business and technical stakeholders will be available for discovery workshops, alignment sessions, and continuous feedback loops
- Active participation from business owners, product owners, and domain experts during key project phases

### Technical Prerequisites
- **System Access**: Full access to current IT environments, including IBM IIB, AWS accounts, data sources, and integration endpoints
- **Development Environments**: Provisioning of development, testing, and staging environments with required software installations
- **Remote Collaboration Tools**: Availability of collaborative platforms for seamless remote integration and communication
- **Data Access and Permissions**: Authorized access to relevant business data sets, logs, and APIs
- **Documentation Access**: Existing architecture documents, system diagrams, coding standards, and operational manuals
- **Code Repositories**: Access to relevant source control systems with appropriate permissions
- **Security & Compliance**: Defined security standards and governance rules for LLM usage and sensitive data handling

### Team and Infrastructure
