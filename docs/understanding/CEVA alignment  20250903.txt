Forwarder and logistic companies in France and one of the top, it's top five in the world. So quite large organization with a presence in all our respective locations. So the stakes are quite interesting for us as a new client.
Vincent Desclaux 4 minutos 25 segundos
For several reasons. First, because it opens up different subsidiary of CMSCGM. Second, because they have a big roadmap and they want to leverage Gen. 2 for 2026 and the reason why they wanted to start now.
Vincent Desclaux 4 minutos 42 segundos
Is to have the first metrics to show to their management to validate their budget for 2026 as they want to deploy Jenny 2 across many of the teams. So here we're in a pilot phase where we on one hand have to to to deliver a working software and on the other hand.
Vincent Desclaux 5 minutos 2 segundos
We have to showcase the gain, the productivity gains and all the gains in terms of quality, documentation, testing and all to SEVA folks. So double stakes on that project, the governance, Fabian, main stakeholders going back to that and then the team in.
