CONTEXT

CEVA Logistics digital team would like to accelerate product evolution, enhance agile processes, and automate its software development lifecycle capabilities. PALO IT and CEVA digital team aligned to solve those challenges via a POC on Gen-e2, PALO IT's AI-Enhanced Software Engineering methodology.​

The scope of the POC would include the implementation of AI-driven coding practices, the automation of test generation and documentation, the Strengthening of DevOps (CI/CD) and security practices (SAST/DAST), the Integration of AI tools into CEVA's current stack (GitLab, AWS, Karate, etc.) and the support of the full development lifecycle from product definition to deployment via new ways of working.​

The expected outcomes would lead to a faster delivery of product enhancements, improved code quality, traceability, and developer productivity, scalable, secure, and sustainable DevOps pipelines and concrete validation of the two selected use cases. (e.g., Renault2MoveECAR inbound flow).
