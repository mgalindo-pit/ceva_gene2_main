# Executive Summary of the Discovery Phase

The first week of the Gen-e2 discovery phase initiates a structured and collaborative deep dive into CEVA’s business and technical landscape, laying the groundwork for a successful 12-week delivery. Emphasizing high stakeholder involvement and AI-augmented facilitation, the week focuses on aligning use case context and business priorities, validating current workflows, understanding integration constraints, and rapidly exploring tooling and environment needs. Key activities include business framing, technical assessments, social contract establishment, and early CI/CD scaffolding—to ensure shared clarity, early risk exposure, and a cohesive delivery setup.

**Key Objectives:**

* Capture and clarify business needs, stakeholder expectations, and technical goals for the two use cases (e.g., ESQL to TypeScript migration).
* Understand legacy constraints (e.g., IBM IIB), integration targets (e.g., AWS Lambda), and AI-assisted delivery opportunities.
* Establish effective team coordination, ceremonies, and working agreements.
* Set up environments and repositories to support early development and testing.
* Initiate AI-powered documentation pipelines and backlog structuring.

# Team Members & Macro Activities: Detailed Description

## Team Members & Roles

**AI Coach (Senior)**
- Orchestrates AI rules contextualization across use cases. - Guides team in prompt design, automation setup, and Gen-e2 best practices.

**Gen-e2 Engineer (Full-Time)**
- Leads implementation of AI-enhanced development workflows and automation tools. - Supports integration of AI pipelines into CI/CD and delivery routines.

**Product / Delivery Coordinator (Local)**
- Acts as product owner proxy; centralizes feedback and stakeholder input. - Manages backlog items and ensures alignment with milestones and KPI.

**Legacy Systems SME (Part-Time)**

## Macro Activities (Week 1)

1. **Business Discovery: Use Case Framing**
   * Stakeholder interviews and vision workshops focused on ticket workflows and integration transformations.
   * Video walkthroughs of legacy IBM IIB flows (ECAR, pipeline sync, etc.)
   * Identification of opportunity gaps and transformation targets.
2. **Technical Gap Assessment**
   * Hands-on environment review (GitLab, AWS, CI/CD, TypeScript compatibility).
   * Establish orchestration between legacy inputs and Gen-e2 flows.
   * Overview and scope of AI integration layers.
3. **Environment & Tooling Kickoff**
   * Set up project repositories, pipelines, environments.
   * Begin documentation automation using AI-enabled orchestration.
4. **Delivery Framing**
   * Define working agreements (social contract, communication rituals).
   * Populate initial planning board and prioritize first sprint items.
   * Clarify validation criteria (success metrics, velocity assumptions).
5. **Prompt Engineering & AI Rule Tests**
   * Draft and validate first AI transformation rules (ESQL → TypeScript).
   * Set up rules tracking and update routine for iterative improvement.

# Day-to-Day Planning (Week 1 - Starting July 7)

### Day 1 (July 7) – Kickoff & Business Visioning

* Kickoff meeting: Introductions, scope review, ways of working
* Social Contract: Roles, communication framework, rituals setup
* Workshop 1: Use Case 1 framing walkthrough (legacy flow narration)
* AI Coach: Capture video and notes to seed prompts/test data
* Begin project documentation pipeline scaffolding
* End-of-day synch & mini-retro

### Day 2 (July 8) – Business Deep Dive & Stakeholder Insights

* Stand-up & daily retro kickoff
* Stakeholder interviews (business + technical)
* Workshop consolidation: Extract personas, current-state map
* Begin documenting “as-is” and “to-be” states
* Environment scaffolding initiated (repos, credentials, GitLab)
* Sync + consolidated notes backed by AI summarization

### Day 3 (July 9) – Technical Discovery Workshop

* Infra ops & DevOps SME interview: Constraints, tooling gaps
* Workshop 2: Technical Alignment – security, access, CI/CD status
* Initial CI/CD prototype defined (GitLab integration with AI runner config)
* Prompt experiment: Basic ESQL-to-TypeScript rule test
* Launch backlog board; seed first items
* Sync & AI-generated reflection doc

### Day 4 (July 10) – Planning & Environment Setup

* Workshop: Actionable backlog from user/tech insights
* End-to-end CI flow dry run (mock commits, build, auto-prompt analysis)
* Pair programming: Define test strategy with AI in the loop
* Document team collaboration routine (Slack, GitLab issues, comments)
* Planning session: Define candidate sprint goals
* End-of-day demo: Draft DevOps + AI flow

### Day 5 (July 11) – Synthesis, Demo, and Handover

* Workshop 3: Synthesis of discoveries, challenges, and first demos
* AI Coach: Finalize draft prompt set v0.1 and rules schema
* Team walk-through of backlog, validation of macro roadmap
* Internal demo of early AI-assisted migration pipeline
* End-of-week team retro
* Share video summary and log to stakeholders

# Week 1 Workshops (Detailed Table)

| **Day** | **Workshop** | **Focus** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Day 1 | Workshop 1: Use Case Vision & Problem Framing | Understand legacy workflows, define user context |
| Day 3 | Workshop 2: Technical Gaps & Infra Planning | Assess SSO, CI/CD, toolchain compatibility, data flows |
| Day 5 | Workshop 3: Discovery Synthesis & DevOps Demo | Validate business-technical alignment, demo AI pipeline test |

# Technical & IP Practices

* Track all GitHub Copilot/LLM tool usage in repo commits/metadata.
* Document AI prompt source, output ownership, and rules lineage.
* Maintain changelogs for rules v0.1 → vX, aligned with CEVA IP requirements.
* Ensure external toolchains are sandboxed and secure under CEVA compliance.
* Logs and environments gated via IT-provisioned credentials only.

# Summary

Week 1 of the Discovery Phase ensures that CEVA’s legacy problem domain is fully understood and documented, immediate technical constraints are surfaced, and that AI-enhanced methods start showing results within days. All business and technical exploration is shared transparently, tracked via AI-enhanced logs, and culminates with a shared backlog, demo pipeline and ready-to-iterate AI workflows heading into week 2.
