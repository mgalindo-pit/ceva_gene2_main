ExeCUtive summary
CEVA Logistics digital team would like to accelerate product evolution, enhance agile processes, and automate its software development lifecycle capabilities. PALO IT and CEVA digital team aligned to solve those challenges via a POC on Gen-e2, PALO IT's AI-Enhanced Software Engineering methodology.

The scope of the POC would include the implementation of AI-driven coding practices, the automation of test generation and documentation, the Strengthening of DevOps (CI/CD) and security practices (SAST/DAST), the Integration of AI tools into CEVA's current stack (GitLab, AWS, Karate, etc.) and the support of the full development lifecycle from product definition to deployment via new ways of working.

The expected outcomes would lead to a faster delivery of product enhancements, improved code quality, traceability, and developer productivity, scalable, secure, and sustainable DevOps pipelines and concrete validation of the two selected use cases. (e.g., Renault2MoveECAR inbound flow).

# OUR APPROACH

1. ENGINE ARCHITECTURE MIGRATION
Core Systems Conversion: Replace UnrealScript with C++ by developping a pipeline that
    - create an intermediate representation of the original script using LLM
    - developp a set of adapter / macro to map existing script function to the UE5
    - then transform the intermediate to C++ code and linking to the adapter

- Modern Graphics Implementation: Update all shaders to UE5's material system

3. CODE AND GAMEPLAY SYSTEMS
We will Analyse the game logic structure then divide the script between Gameplay-Scipt-to-C++ pipleine and Gameplay-Scipt-to-blueprint pipeline, and use the same approach than the Core system
    - create an intermediate representation of the original script using LLM
    - developp a set of adapter / macro to map existing script function to the UE5
    - then transform the intermediate to C++ or blueprint  code and linking to the adapter
We will use the UE5 network standart
We will use the tsndart UE5 control mapping (disability remaping etc...)
Rely on native UE5 physic

- Gameplay Systems:

### Notes:
 PREREQUISITES AND ASSUMPTIONS FOR PHASE 1
To ensure a successful pre-production phase, the following prerequisites and assumptions are critical:
Technical Prerequisites
Complete access to original UT2003 source code including all UnrealScript files
Full access to original UE3 build tools and documentation
Clean build environment for both UE3 and UE5.5
Access to original game assets in their raw formats (not just packaged files)
Development licenses for UE5.5
Physical or virtual hardware that meets or exceeds UE5.5 recommended specifications
Source control system with branching capabilities (GitHub Enterprise or similar)
Knowledge Prerequisites
Team members with experience in both UE3 and UE5 development
Expertise in UnrealScript to C++/Blueprint conversion techniques
Understanding of UE3's rendering pipeline and material system
Knowledge of UE5's enhanced input system and Chaos Physics
Familiarity with the gameplay mechanics of Unreal Tournament
Assumptions
The original game code is well-commented and follows consistent coding patterns
No fundamental game mechanics will be redesigned during the port (faithful reproduction)
VIRTUOS will provide timely feedback on technical demonstrators (within 3 business days)
No major UE5 updates that would break compatibility will be released during development
The team can establish a reliable automated testing framework for comparing gameplay behavior
Third-party middleware used in the original game has modern equivalents or can be replaced
Asset conversion will focus on compatibility first, visual enhancement second
Network code can be largely reimplemented rather than ported directly
Access and Support
Direct communication channel with original game architects if possible
Access to internal UE5 support channels for technical roadblocks
Regular access to QA resources for gameplay verification
Agreement on acceptance criteria for each technical demonstrator
These prerequisites and assumptions will be validated during the initial discovery phase, with any gaps identified and addressed before proceeding to the technical demonstrator phases.

# OUR APPROACH

1. ENGINE ARCHITECTURE MIGRATION
Core Systems Conversion: Replace UnrealScript with C++ by developping a pipeline that
    - create an intermediate representation of the original script using LLM
    - developp a set of adapter / macro to map existing script function to the UE5
    - then transform the intermediate to C++ code and linking to the adapter

2. RENDERING PIPELINE OVERHAUL
- Modern Graphics Implementation: Update all shaders to UE5's material system

3. CODE AND GAMEPLAY SYSTEMS
We will Analyse the game logic structure then divide the script between Gameplay-Scipt-to-C++ pipleine and Gameplay-Scipt-to-blueprint pipeline, and use the same approach than the Core system
    - create an intermediate representation of the original script using LLM
    - developp a set of adapter / macro to map existing script function to the UE5
    - then transform the intermediate to C++ or blueprint  code and linking to the adapter
We will use the UE5 network standart
We will use the tsndart UE5 control mapping (disability remaping etc...)
Rely on native UE5 physic

- Gameplay Systems:
We will create the state machine etc... to use the UE5 standart approach
We will extract the gameplay parameter, setup test mechanism and fine tune the new engine

4. ASSET CONVERSION AND ENHANCEMENT
We will rely on moderm LOD generation (continuous or pre-build)
We will implement a level converter tool, and rely on UE5 for streaming (at least at the gebining)
We will

5. NETWORKING AND ONLINE FEATURES
We will Implement UE5's enhanced networking model.

7. BUILD PIPELINE UPGRADE
We will build a fully CICD modern pipeline based on UE recomandation (hybrid local cloud, non regression etc...)

## TEAM COMPOSITION
We propose the followin team:
- 3 Palowans full time
- 2 Virtuos full time (including QA)

## TEAM ORGANISATION
We will organise the team using our GEN-E2 appraoch: Mob programing, daily build, hyper communication, weekly demo and retro, strong engagement and commitment etc...

# PHASING

We will structure into 3 phase:
- Pre production (9 Weeks)
- Production (17 weeks)
- Polish (4 weeks)

Each phase a dedicated Greenlight Milestones with clear acceptance criteria and deliverables.

The 3 Greenlight Milestones will be:
- Vertical Slice (at the end of the pre production): with the objective to have validated all the technical faisibility, validate the estimation and production tasks
- Beta: at the end of the production: with all the asset, function.... delivered
- Gold: at the end of the polish phase

Other milestones (Alpha, tech demo, inception...) will be included in the 3 phases, enhencing the control and ensuring the structured delivery of the artifacts.

At each phase / sub phase, we have a go-no go decision for the next phase, in order to reduce the risk and stop the project as soon as technical blocked are identified

## TARGETED PRODUCTIVITY GAINS

We target:
    - 37% of Total cost reduction
    - 25% of time to market reduction
    - reusable pipeline components
    - fully documented and scalable approach

We target 37% of productivit to deliver in 7,5 months with 5 people (38 Men Month compar):
    - 15% gains on the organisation (MOB, Methodology...)
    - 25% gains on the production time (AI Acceleration)
    - Standart pipeline components ready to be fine tuned for another game portage
