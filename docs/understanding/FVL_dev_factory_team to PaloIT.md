Gitlab Ticket Management: Focus on how to get your tickets ready for a project
Digital Factory

### Notes:

<!-- Slide number: 38 -->

# New tickets opened by Project Managers and Project Business Analysts

An Epic should be created for the set of tickets (set of gitlab issue tickets) contained in a project to be delivered for the Business goals.

To get the Digital Factory to work in a Gitlab issue ticket, please follow instructions and how-to guidelines provided by the Development team. In nutshell, you can see here the minimum information needed to create a ticket in Gitlab.

Gitlab issue ticket template must be introduced to get the ticket planned by the Digital factory.

![Interfaz de usuario gráfica, Texto, Aplicación Descripción generada automáticamente](Picture5.jpg)

<!-- Slide number: 39 -->

# Functional Project requirements and gap analysis to be split into Digital Factory gitlab issues

A Functional requirement or MoveIT gap analysis would mean several tickets in MoveIT Products.

It could be the case a requirement means several tickets. This will be managed between the Project Business Analyst and the Product Owners.

To get ready for deployment a requirement or a gap analysis, you need all tickets within a sprint planned.

Gitlab EPIC management is key for coordination.

<!-- Slide number: 40 -->

# Getting tickets planned for a project
A ticket created need to be validated by the Product Owner. Business Analysts,  work in the Conception of the ticket and gets the PO approval before any code development.

Gitlab Ticket issue planning will be determined by the end of the conception of the ticket. RTE will check with the Development team on the ticket sizing ,which is the delivery date requested and based on those and the outcome of priorities defined by business in the new Demand Process,  ticket will be managed within the refinement and sprint planning.

Every ticket must be approved by the Product Owner. Unless a ticket is in label/status equals to "To Do" will not be planned by the team and still standing in the backlog awaiting to be planned.

Opened tickets are managed by the RTE taking into account the "Strategic Alignment Score" outcome sent by prioritization Business board.

![A green and white rectangle with black text Description automatically generated](Picture5.jpg)

<!-- Slide number: 41 -->

# New Gitlab tickets issue TEMPLATES for guidance
New input for the tickets are mandatory:

Tracking (orchestra and servicenow info for tickets)
Delivery date (please always real one, if not al planning will be wrong)
In case of incident/bugs additional information
Steps to reproduce
Expected behavior
Spec Link
Definition of Ticket Ready for Development (DoR) (ticket will be planned with a delivery date)
As a [user]: Explain who you're building this product for (user)
I want to [goal]: Describe the user’s intentions rather than how they get there. The goal matters more than implementation.
So that [benefit]: Break down how meeting a goal benefits the user. Remember to look at the bigger picture or a deeper desire in users.

Definition of ticket done. Testing acceptance criteria.
Given: The initial context is received.
When: One or more actions are performed.
Then: The action results are checked against expectations.

Gitlab and Release Note
# Objectives
Make a clear process for
Tech Release Note: Detailed and technical, prepared for both TST and PROD. ((Auto in GitLab))
Product Release Note: Filtered and user-friendly, created and validated by the PO for both TST and PROD.

This solution takes in account:
No use of Deployer for RN ==> All in GitLab
No complication for POs/users
No more columns in the "Sprint Board"
No development needed
Ready for Go No Go
Ready on time for deployment (TST and PROD)

WE ONLY SPEAK FOR NOW ABOUT MAJOR RELEASE NOTES
 (Release Notes for minor versions and patches?!)

<!-- Slide number: 44 -->

# Dates in GitLab
Iteration : This information gives the « when » the ticket is developped (= Sprint)
Iteration dates are automatic in GitLaB / Team. Must be completed during Sprint planning
Milestone : This information gives the « when » the ticket is deployed (=Release)
Milestones will be created in each team. Must be completed on Merging the issue

Due Date : When the issue is expected by Business team
Ideal date for having this issue in PRODUCTION for business Team

<!-- Slide number: 45 -->

# Release Note creation
The sprint starts with a commitment from Sprint Planning. The issues are in To-Do and we can already put the milestone to generate the “Tech Release Note”
By updating status of issues in GitLab, the Release Note based on Milestone is automatically updated.
Each time an issue is Merged AND need to be communicated, the PO should add it to the “Product Release Note Template”
Before the Go/No-Go, the PO completes the “Product Release Note” looking in gitlab at all issues closed in the Milestone.
The Feature (Product) Release Note for TST should be ready for the Go/No-Go for deployment in TST (Monday of 3rd week)
The TST Release Note can be shared as soon as we have the GO (with date of release)
The PROD Release Note needs to be ready gor the GO/No-Go to PROD
The PROD Release Note can be shared as soon as we have ended the Release

<!-- Slide number: 46 -->

# Release Note (with Milestone)
The tech Release Note is Automaticly generated in GitLab if we use Milestone as Release (No new action for PO/BA)
All issues with code should hold a Milestone. This allows to « separate » iteration and Release/Milestone
It is VERY important to update statuses and put the milestone so as to have the Release Note OK and available in GitLab

![](Image6.jpg)
It will be available everytime and automatic depending on the update of the issues in GitLab 

<!-- Slide number: 47 -->

# Product Owner Release Note
The « Product Release Note » will be done by Pos and shared on the day of Go/No Go with the teams, and with users/business/stakeholders on the day of release
This Release Note has to be created and communicated by each PO.
Feature Release Note TST : on TST deployment, before Demo
Feature Release Note PROD : The day of Release

<!-- Slide number: 49 -->

# Getting tickets planned for a project
A ticket created will be managed by the Product Owner and Product Business Analysts, reviewed and work in the Conception of the ticket before any refinement or code development.

Gitlab Ticket issue planning will be determined by the end of the conception of the ticket. Product owner will check with the Development team on the ticket details, sizing and also as of when this ticket will be managed within next sprint during sprint planning.

Every ticket must be approved by the Product Owner. Unless a ticket is in label/status equals to "To Do“, it will not be planned by the team and keep standing in conception in the backlog waiting to be refined, validated and planned.

Opened tickets are managed by the Product Owners taking into account the "Strategic Alignment Score" outcome sent by prioritization Business board.

We need to give dates of commitments on several issues

| Dev | Unit Test the ticket and/or feature | Développer BA\* / PO | Will be used for PO/BA testing | Issue is deployed to QAL (ideally should move it to “closed” but we are not doing it) Issue in To Test Test Evidence of ticket ready for QAL. |
| QAL | Features ready for test are merged and deployed there Testing New Features TRAININGS | BA\* / PO | Data\*?Not always and not everyone tests in QAL the tickets/features. Many times they’re just tested in DEV and considered OK to go to QAL which is just used to create the package for TST env. | Testing Go NoGo for TST (all new features are OK) |
| TST | Hotfixes ready for test are merged and deployed there Testing of Release / Hotfixes Compound Roll-outs and migrations. | PO\*/BA/Support QA testing team | Only env that should be ISO after every Release to be able to test. Need to activate incoming messages for testing. | Go NoGo from PO (Package/hotfixes) to launch NRT\*\* |
| PROD | Happy flow (checking if all works well, without Writing) | Support/PO | Release in prod should happen last day of sprint! | Release note 3.X.Y |

Agile Developments	Developed components are independent. Each developer can move forward autonomously without waiting for another team.
  While following all agile software development best practices, unlike a classic Scrum methodology, current development does not rely on sprints to deliver functionality

![Une image contenant cercle, Graphique, logo, symbole Description générée automatiquement](Image10.jpg)
Improved time-to-market
Accelerated development: each component advances in isolation, enabling short cycles and rapid validation.
Optimized time-to-market: A component can be delivered when it is ready, without waiting for the others to be integrated.

![Fusée avec un remplissage uni](Graphique6.jpg)
Automated deployment
Efficiency gains: repetitive manual tasks (build, test, integration, deployment) are automated, reducing the time needed for each delivery.
Increased reliability: Reduced human error thanks to automated processes.
Standardized deployments with controlled scripts and pipelines.
