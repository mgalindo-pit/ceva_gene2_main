# GenE2
The current document include the stack of practices, tools and artifacts used in the GenE2 schema- The next topics have to be covered during trainings.

# Artifacts

## Templates
- Product Requirements Document
- User Story/Functional Requirement
- Architecture Decision Record
- Implementation Plan (before generate code)
- Backend Architecture
- Front end Architecture

## Standards
- Project structure, locations and file naming conventions
- Code Standards (how to write code and how to write tests)
- Code review standards (things to check during code review)

## Prompts
- Generate User Story
- Generate Implementation Plan
- Implement a User Story (update documentation, code, tests) 
- Execute Code Review
- Generate first draft of architecture

## Chat Modes
- Behavior such as a product owner and business analyst expert
- Behavior such as a developer
- Behavior such as a code reviewer
- Behavior such as a security expert
- Behavior such as a devops

## MCP
