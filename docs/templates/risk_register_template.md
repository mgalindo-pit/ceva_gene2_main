## Critical Risks (Priority: Critical/High)

### RISK-001: ESQL Code Complexity
**Category**: Technical  
**Probability**: Medium  
**Impact**: High  
**Priority**: High  

**Description**: The ESQL codebase may be more complex than anticipated, containing legacy patterns, undocumented business logic, or technical debt that could significantly slow migration efforts.

**Potential Consequences**:
- Extended timeline for analysis and migration
- Incomplete or incorrect business logic translation
- Need for extensive CEVA SME involvement
- Budget overruns due to increased complexity

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Conduct thorough code analysis in Week 1
- Engage ESQL experts early in the process
- Create comprehensive test suite before migration
- Plan for 20% buffer time in migration estimates

**Contingency Plans**:
- Identify alternative migration approach (hybrid/phased)
- Engage external ESQL specialists if needed
- Reduce scope to core functionality if necessary

### RISK-002: Stakeholder Alignment
**Category**: Business  
**Probability**: Medium  
**Impact**: High  
**Priority**: High  

**Description**: Key stakeholders may have different expectations or understanding of Gen-e2 methodology and POC outcomes, leading to misaligned success criteria.

**Potential Consequences**:
- Scope creep or changing requirements
- Dissatisfaction with deliverables
- Failure to secure future funding
- Project cancellation or reputation damage

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Conduct thorough stakeholder mapping and interviews
- Document and validate success criteria with all stakeholders
- Regular communication and demo sessions
- Clear change management process

**Contingency Plans**:

### RISK-003: Performance Requirements
**Category**: Technical  
**Probability**: Medium  
**Impact**: High  
**Priority**: High  

**Description**: Migrated TypeScript/Lambda solution may not meet current performance requirements or SLAs of the IBM IIB system.

**Potential Consequences**:
- Failed performance acceptance criteria
- Need for significant optimization work
- Architecture redesign requirements
- Negative perception of Gen-e2 methodology

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Establish clear performance baselines early
- Design performance testing into development process
- Architecture review with AWS experts
- Performance optimization as continuous activity

**Contingency Plans**:
- Alternative AWS services (Fargate, ECS)
- Hybrid architecture approach
- Performance optimization sprint

**Owner**: Technical Architect  
**Status**: Open

## High Risks

### RISK-004: Tool Integration Challenges
**Category**: Technical  
**Probability**: High  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Priority**: High  

**Description**: Integration of Gen-e2 tools (GitHub Copilot, VSCode plugins) with CEVA's security policies and existing development environment may face technical or policy barriers.

**Potential Consequences**:
- Delayed environment setup
- Reduced Gen-e2 methodology effectiveness
- Manual workarounds reducing productivity gains
- Security compliance issues

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Early engagement with CEVA IT security team
- Proof of concept for tool integration
- Alternative tool options evaluation
- Security policy review and adjustment process

**Contingency Plans**:
- Alternative AI tools that meet security requirements
- Modified Gen-e2 approach with approved tools
- Manual processes with AI assistance where possible

### RISK-005: Team Adoption Resistance
**Category**: People  
**Probability**: Medium  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Priority**: Medium  

**Description**: CEVA development teams may resist adopting new AI-assisted development practices or may not embrace the Gen-e2 methodology effectively.

**Potential Consequences**:
- Reduced methodology effectiveness
- Lower productivity gains than expected
- Negative feedback on Gen-e2 approach
- Difficulty scaling post-POC

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Comprehensive training program
- Change management approach
- Early wins demonstration
- Team involvement in tool selection

**Contingency Plans**:
- Extended training period
- Gradual introduction of practices
- Team coaching and mentoring
